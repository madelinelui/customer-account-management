## How to set-up the application

To set-up the react application, you will need to:

1. Open the Java project (REST-API repository) on Eclipse
2. Go to the RestApiRepositoryApplication.java file, right click and Run it as a Spring-boot application. The default port is :8090. If it is taken, kill the port in the terminal by: "lsof -i :8090" then "kill -9 < PID >".
3. Open the React web app on VS Code
4. Open a terminal in the project on VS Code. Alternatively, go to your terminal on your desktop, and change your current directory to the React web app folder. Then, type "npm start". The default port is :3000.
5. It should open up in your web-browser. If not, try Chrome.
6. If you need help navigating the application, consult the User Guide PDF file, where I've included detailed instructions with screenshots.
